# About Ecto-Trigger

Ecto-Trigger is a code-base which supports the development of lightweight MobileNetv2 models for (prescence/abscence) binary image classification. This software supports our paper: [Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14467) (currently pre-print), where we use this as a method to detect insect ectotherms in natural images. 

Here you will find code for training, testing and deployment of binary classifier models, including saliency map analysis tools and quantisation toolkits. Our pre-trained weights for insect detection are also available with a range of model sizes.

## Performance

We tested Ecto-Trigger on a challenging use-case, finding  images which contain insects. 

## What is it for?

Ecto-Trigger is for use-cases with extremely tight computational demands where a continuous stream of images is required..
