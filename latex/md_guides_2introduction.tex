Ecto-\/\+Trigger is software which aims to help others develop very lightweight "{}tiny\+ML"{} AI models for deployment onto microcontrollers or other edge computing devices. In this case models perform for binary classification tasks, specifically for detecting the presence or absence of objects in images. This libarary uses Mobile\+Netv2, which is particularly suited for scenarios where computational efficiency is critical, such as real-\/time image filtering on resource-\/constrained devices.\hypertarget{md_guides_2introduction_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Who is this for?}{Who is this for?}}\label{md_guides_2introduction_autotoc_md7}

Overall, Ecto-\/\+Trigger is designed for researchers, developers, and hobbyists working across the fields of computer vision, embedded systems, and environmental monitoring. It is particularly useful for those looking to deploy AI models on microcontrollers for tasks like wildlife monitoring, insect detection, or other lightweight image classification applications.\hypertarget{md_guides_2introduction_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Why use Ecto-\/\+Trigger?}{Why use Ecto-\/\+Trigger?}}\label{md_guides_2introduction_autotoc_md8}
Ecto-\/\+Trigger provides a complete pipeline for training, evaluating, quantising, and deploying lightweight binary classification models. It simplifies the process of creating models that can run efficiently on devices with limited computational resources. Key features include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Model Training}}\+: Train Mobile\+Net\+V2-\/based binary classifiers with custom datasets.
\item {\bfseries{Evaluation}}\+: Evaluate model performance and visualize results using saliency maps.
\item {\bfseries{Quantisation}}\+: Convert models to TFLite format with INT8 precision for deployment on microcontrollers.
\item {\bfseries{Deployment Guidance}}\+: Detailed instructions for deploying models on platforms like Raspberry Pi and ESP32-\/\+S3.
\item {\bfseries{Pre-\/trained Models}}\+: Access to pre-\/trained models for insect detection, as described in our paper.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Dataset Format Issues}}\+: Ensure your dataset is in YOLO annotation format. Incorrect formatting can cause errors during data loading. Refer to the FAQs for details.
\item {\bfseries{Class Imbalance}}\+: Imbalanced datasets can lead to poor model performance. Balance your dataset with equal parts of positive and negative samples.
\item {\bfseries{Memory Errors During Training}}\+: If you encounter memory issues, reduce the batch size or input image resolution.
\item {\bfseries{Quantization Errors}}\+: Ensure the representative dataset used for quantization matches the input shape of the model.
\item {\bfseries{Deployment Issues on Microcontrollers}}\+: Verify that the model fits within the memory constraints of the target device. Enable PSRAM on ESP32-\/\+S3 if needed.
